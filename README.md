## Wolfram Cellular Automata Visualizer v1.0.0-alpha
> Fairly functional application allowing users to visualize Wolfram's generalized cellular automata, with different starting points and animations.

### Current features
* Animated visualization of cellular automata
* Several different starting points presets

### Upgrade Steps
* Bad bugs if users change settings while "animation" (just event handling) running
* Current input is a StringVar per tkinter conventions but need an alternative so that users don't have the ability to type words/numbers higher than 255 (though latter is really only a performance issue)
* Canvas/image resizing (higher resolution, better detailing on more fractal-y automata)
* More starting point/image presets
* User color choice
* User pixel sizing
* Automata export functionality
